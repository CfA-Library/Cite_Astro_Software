# Software Release Articles in Astronomy and Computing
William O'Mullane pulled this from the ASCOM twiki - much of the original text was from Norman Gray from July 2014. 


Astronomy and Computing accepts software papers - 
We see these a special category of paper which describes some software.

These are to be treated slightly differently to other papers in that some extra guidelines for Authors and Reviewers will be put in place.

# Single  packages
The package should have demonstrated use in astronomy of and the paper should have significant intellectual content.

 The package may be submitted to ASCL - but they require a ‘peer reviewed’ article stating use of the package in astronomy. This is picked up in ADS.
 The paper may be submitted to software X Journal- is it ready ?

# Full system with full description
These have  many details and formula about the implementation - this type we accept and review - with the new guidelines.


# Structure

Should we try to agree common contents and perhaps even suggest a structure for Authors ?

We decided a structure is not needed but editors should check for the following as part of the process.

## Contents

    Major/Main algorithm description
    Test results
    How to get the software
    Basic User Manual examples and where to get full docs
    Discussion/analysis of decisions made: why did the authors do X? what can others learn from the experience of developing X?

For some papers, however , it's not completely clear what should be added, or what the reviewer should do. Adding a lot of analysis to a  paper would seem artificial: "why did you do it that way?", "well, ermmm, because it's the usual way of doing it, implemented in XXXLANG..."


# Goals

What is the function of a 'software paper'?


    An intellectually rigorous and engaging analysis of a software problem relevant to astronomy or  a science paper with significant software aspect .
    A stable referenceable object: a hook for a citation, which is not intended to be a significant intellectual achievement in itself; it's a handle for the software achievement, no more.
